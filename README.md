# Spotify Analysis ðŸŽµ
An analysis of one's Spotify Account with the use of their listening habits. Built with HTML + Flask, it provides rich playlist information, curates a playlist based on specific factors, and predicts one's mood based on their music listening habits.

## How it works
Utilizing both the Spotify API along with Google's NLP API, this application can generate a better emotion classifier, as well as providing visualizations on user's insights with a fresh prespective. 

### Authentication
When the user first visits the web application, they are prompted to link their Spotify account. During this process, the backend portion of the app generates a JSON header to send to Spotify's server. This authentication token permits the service to access the user's account for the duration of one browser session, so if the user refreshes the page, the application keeps the token alive with the use of a refresh token (in order to convey to Spotify that the session was still logged in). 

### Mood Detection
Once the user logs in to their Spotify account and grants all of the necessary permissions, they view a dashboard pre-populated with the user's current mood, as well as the respective mood of each playlist in their library. The generation of these metrics involve multiple steps, outlined below:
- ***Lyric Sentiment Analysis*** - For any set of songs that were being analyzed (whether it be the user's most recent playlist or their last 50 songs), the program fetched the lyrics for all the songs in question (with the use of the Genius API). After retrieving these lyrics, the program called Google's Natural Language Processing API in order to perform sentiment analysis on these words. With the use of these calculations, the program devised a score based on soley the lyrics, one key metric utilized in calculating the final score.
- ***Spotify's Data*** - Spotify's API provides a variety of song data itself, so the program fetched the data from the API in order to use a song's happiness, tempo, valence, danceability, and a couple of other metrics to calculate another score for the song based soley on spotify data.
- ***Mood Vector*** - After training with over 100 songs that classified each mood, and performing the calculations mentioned above on all of these songs, we used this trained dataset to create a baseline mood vector for each of these moods
- ***Classifying a Song's Mood*** When retrieving a song's specific vector, the program performs an error analysis of this vector (essentially comparing it to the standard vectors mentioned above). The vector that has the least amount of errors is then declared the mood of that song.
